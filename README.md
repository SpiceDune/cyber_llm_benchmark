## 📝 Introduction

The Cyber LLM Benchmark project aims to evaluate the performance of various large language models on cybersecurity tasks. This includes tasks such as threat detection, vulnerability assessment, and incident response. By providing a standardized benchmarking framework, we aim to advance the field of cybersecurity through the use of state-of-the-art LLMs.

## 🌟 Features

- **Standardized Benchmarking**: Consistent and comparable evaluation metrics.
- **Wide Range of Tasks**: Includes multiple cybersecurity-related tasks.
- **Extensible Framework**: Easily add new tasks and models.
- **Comprehensive Reports**: Detailed performance reports and visualizations.

## ⚙️ Installation

To get started with the Cyber LLM Benchmark, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SpiceDune/cyber_llm_benchmark.git
   cd cyber_llm_benchmark
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## 🚀 Usage

To run the benchmark, use the following command:

```bash
python main.py
```

## 📊 Benchmarking

The benchmarking process involves evaluating the performance of different LLMs on various cybersecurity tasks. The results are then compiled into detailed reports, which include metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

### Example Tasks

- **Threat Detection**: Identifying potential security threats from given inputs.
- **Vulnerability Assessment**: Analyzing systems for potential vulnerabilities.
- **Incident Response**: Generating appropriate responses to security incidents.

### Adding New Tasks

To add a new task, follow these steps:

1. Create a new Python file in the `tasks` directory.
2. Implement the task logic and evaluation metrics.
3. Update the `tasks/__init__.py` file to include the new task.
