3. **Make sure Ollama is installed**

You can read instructions to install ollama [here](https://ollama.com/download) 

Once Ollama is installed  Install following models by executing

```bash
   ollama run llama3
   ollama run mistral
```

---

## 🚀 Usage

To run the benchmark, use the following command:

```bash
python main.py
```

---

## 📊 Benchmarking

The benchmarking process involves evaluating the performance of different LLMs on various cybersecurity tasks. The results are then compiled into detailed reports, which include metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

### Example Tasks

- 🛡️ **Threat Detection**: Identifying potential security threats from given inputs.
- 🛠️ **Vulnerability Assessment**: Analyzing systems for potential vulnerabilities.
- 🚑 **Incident Response**: Generating appropriate responses to security incidents.

### Adding New Tasks

To add a new task, follow these steps:

1. 📂 Create a new Python file in the `tasks` directory.
2. ✏️ Implement the task logic and evaluation metrics.
3. 🔄 Update the `tasks/__init__.py` file to include the new task.
